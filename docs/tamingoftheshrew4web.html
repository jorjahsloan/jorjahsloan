			<p class="verseline">Saw’st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</p>

			<p class="verseline">I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</p>
			<p class="character">First Huntsman</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;</p>
			<p class="verseline">He cried upon it at the merest loss,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</p>
			<p class="verseline">What think you, if he were convey’d to bed,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wrapp’d in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</p>
			<p class="verseline">A most delicious banquet by his bed,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</p>

			<p class="character">First Huntsman</p>
			<p class="verseline">Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</p>
			<p class="character">Second Huntsman</p>
			<p class="verseline">It would seem strange unto him when he wak’d.</p>
			<p class="character">Lord</p>
			<p class="verseline">Even as a flatt’ring dream or worthless fancy.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then take him up, and manage well the jest:</p>

			<p class="verseline">And hang it round with all my wanton pictures;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Procure me music ready when he wakes,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And if he chance to speak, be ready straight,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And with a low submissIVe reverence</p>
			<p class="verseline">Say ‘What is it your honour will command?’</p>
			<p class="verseline">Let one attend him with a silver basin</p>
			<p class="verseline">Full of rose-water and bestrew’d with flowers;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And say ‘Will’t please your lordship cool your hands?’</p>
			<p class="verseline">Some one be ready with a costly suit,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And ask him what apparel he will wear;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And that his lady mourns at his disease;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Persuade him that he hath been lunatic,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, when he says he is, say that he dreams,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</p>
			<p class="verseline">This do, and do it kindly, gentle sirs;</p>
			<p class="verseline">It will be pastime passing excellent,</p>
			<p class="verseline">If it be husbanded with modesty.</p>
			<p class="character">First Huntsman</p>

			<p class="verseline">Since once he play’d a farmer’s eldest son;</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Twas where you woo’d the gentlewoman so well.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</p>
			<p class="verseline">Was aptly fitted and naturally perform’d.</p>
			<p class="character">Player</p>
			<p class="verseline">I think ‘twas Soto that your honour means.</p>
			<p class="character">Lord</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis very true; thou didst it excellent.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, you are come to me in happy time,</p>
			<p class="verseline">The rather for I have some sport in hand</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</p>
			<p class="verseline">There is a lord will hear you play to-night;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But I am doubtful of your modesties,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Lest, over-eying of his odd behaviour,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For yet his honour never heard a play,</p>
			<p class="verseline">You break into some merry passion</p>
			<p class="verseline">And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</p>
			<p class="verseline">If you should smile, he grows impatient.</p>
			<p class="character">Player</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fear not, my lord; we can contain ourselves,</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exit one with the Players</h2>
			<p class="verseline">Sirrah, go you to Bartholomew my page,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And see him dress’d in all suits like a lady;</p>
			<p class="verseline">That done, conduct him to the drunkard’s chamber,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And call him ‘madam,’ do him obeisance.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tell him from me- as he will win my love-</p>
			<p class="verseline">He bear himself with honourable action,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Such as he hath observ’d in noble ladies</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto their lords, by them accomplished;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Such duty to the drunkard let him do,</p>
			<p class="verseline">With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And say ‘What is’t your honour will command,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Wherein your lady and your humble wife</p>
			<p class="verseline">May show her duty and make known her love?’</p>
			<p class="verseline">And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And with declining head into his bosom,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Bid him shed tears, as being overjoyed</p>
			<p class="verseline">To see her noble lord restor’d to health,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who for this seven years hath esteemed him</p>
			<p class="verseline">No better than a poor and loathsome beggar.</p>
			<p class="verseline">And if the boy have not a woman’s gift</p>
			<p class="verseline">To rain a shower of commanded tears,</p>

			<p class="character">Sly</p>
			<p class="verseline">For God’s sake, a pot of small ale.</p>

			<p class="prose">I am Christophero Sly; call not me ‘honour’ nor ‘lordship.’ I ne’er drank sack in my life; and if you gIVe me any conserves, gIVe me conserves of beef. Ne’er ask me what raiment I’ll wear, for I have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings than legs, nor no more shoes than feet- nay, sometime more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my toes look through the overleather.</p>

Am not I Christopher Sly, old Sly’s son of Burton Heath; by birth a pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker? Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if she know me not; if she say I am not fourteen pence on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the lying’st knave in</p>

			<p class="verseline">Dost thou love pictures? We will fetch thee straight</p>
			<p class="verseline">Adonis painted by a running brook,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And Cytherea all in sedges hid,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Which seem to move and wanton with her breath</p>
			<p class="verseline">Even as the waving sedges play wi’ th’ wind.</p>
			<p class="character">Lord</p>
			<p class="verseline">We’ll show thee lo as she was a maid</p>

			<p class="verseline">Like envious floods o’er-run her lovely face,</p>

			<p class="verseline">Is there any man has rebus’d your worship?</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.</p>

			<p class="prose">Knock you here, sir? Why, sir, what am I, sir, that I should knock you here, sir?</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Villain, I say, knock me at this gate,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And rap me well, or I’ll knock your knave’s pate.</p>
			<p class="character">Grumio</p>
			<p class="verseline">My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock you first,</p>

			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Will it not be?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Faith, sirrah, an you’ll not knock I’ll ring it;</p>

			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Enter Hortensio</h2>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="prose">How now! what’s the matter? My old friend Grumio and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Con tutto il cuore ben trovato’ may I say.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Alla nostra casa ben venuto,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Molto honorato signor mio Petruchio.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Rise, Grumio, rise; we will compound this quarrel.</p>
			<p class="character">Grumio</p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, ‘tis no matter, sir, what he ‘leges in Latin. If this be not a lawful cause for me to leave his service- look you, sir: he bid me knock him and rap him soundly, sir. Well, was it fit for a servant to use his master so; being, perhaps, for aught I see, two and thirty, a pip out?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whom would to God I had well knock’d at first,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then had not Grumio come by the worst.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I bade the rascal knock upon your gate,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And could not get him for my heart to do it.</p>
			<p class="character">Grumio</p>
			<p class="prose">Knock at the gate? O heavens! Spake you not these words plain: ‘Sirrah knock me here, rap me here, knock me well, and knock me soundly’? And come you now with ‘knocking at the gate’?</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio’s pledge;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, this’s a heavy chance ‘twixt him and you,</p>

			<p class="verseline">And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale</p>
			<p class="verseline">Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Such wind as scatters young men through the world</p>
			<p class="verseline">To seek their fortunes farther than at home,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where small experience grows. But in a few,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Antonio, my father, is deceas’d,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And I have thrust myself into this maze,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Haply to wIVe and thrIVe as best I may;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Crowns in my purse I have, and goods at home,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And so am come abroad to see the world.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee</p>
			<p class="verseline">And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour’d wife?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thou’dst thank me but a little for my counsel,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And yet I’ll promise thee she shall be rich,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And very rich; but th’art too much my friend,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And I’ll not wish thee to her.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Signior Hortensio, ‘twixt such friends as we</p>
			<p class="verseline">Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know</p>
			<p class="verseline">One rich enough to be Petruchio’s wife,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Be she as foul as was Florentius’ love,</p>
			<p class="verseline">As old as Sibyl, and as curst and shrewd</p>
			<p class="verseline">As Socrates’ Xanthippe or a worse-</p>
			<p class="verseline">She moves me not, or not removes, at least,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Affection’s edge in me, were she as rough</p>
			<p class="verseline">As are the swelling Adriatic seas.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I come to wIVe it wealthily in Padua;</p>
			<p class="verseline">If wealthily, then happily in Padua.</p>
			<p class="character">Grumio</p>
			<p class="prose">Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his mind is.</p>
			<p class="prose">Why, gIVe him gold enough and marry him to a puppet or an aglet-baby, or an old trot with ne’er a tooth in her head, though she has as many diseases as two and fifty horses. Why, nothing comes amiss, so money comes withal.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Petruchio, since we are stepp’d thus far in,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will continue that I broach’d in jest.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife</p>
			<p class="verseline">With wealth enough, and young and beauteous;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her only fault, and that is faults enough,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is- that she is intolerable curst,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And shrewd and froward so beyond all measure</p>
			<p class="verseline">That, were my state far worser than it is,</p>
			<p class="verseline">I would not wed her for a mine of gold.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hortensio, peace! thou know’st not gold’s effect.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tell me her father’s name, and ‘tis enough;</p>
			<p class="verseline">For I will board her though she chide as loud</p>
			<p class="verseline">As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her father is Baptista Minola,</p>
			<p class="verseline">An affable and courteous gentleman;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her name is Katherina Minola,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Renown’d in Padua for her scolding tongue.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I know her father, though I know not her;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And he knew my deceased father well.</p>
			<p class="verseline">I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And therefore let me be thus bold with you</p>
			<p class="verseline">To gIVe you over at this first encounter,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unless you will accompany me thither.</p>
			<p class="character">Grumio</p>
			<p class="prose">I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts. O’ my word, and she knew him as well as I do, she would think scolding would do little good upon him. She may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so. Why, that’s nothing; and he begin once, he’ll rail in his rope-tricks. I’ll tell you what, sir: an she stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in her face, and so disfigure her with it that she shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat. You know him not, sir.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For in Baptista’s keep my treasure is.</p>
			<p class="verseline">He hath the jewel of my life in hold,</p>
			<p class="verseline">His youngest daughter, beautiful Bianca;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And her withholds from me, and other more,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Suitors to her and rIVals in my love;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Supposing it a thing impossible-</p>
			<p class="verseline">For those defects I have before rehears’d-</p>
			<p class="verseline">That ever Katherina will be woo’d.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Therefore this order hath Baptista ta’en,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That none shall have access unto Bianca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Till Katherine the curst have got a husband.</p>
			<p class="character">Grumio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Katherine the curst!</p>
			<p class="verseline">A title for a maid of all titles the worst.</p>

			<p class="verseline">Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,</p>

			<p class="verseline">To old Baptista as a schoolmaster</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;</p>
			<p class="verseline">That so I may by this device at least</p>

			<p class="verseline">Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?</p>

			<p class="prose">Why, Petruchio is coming- in a new hat and an old jerkin; a pair of old breeches thrice turn’d; a pair of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled, another lac’d; an old rusty sword ta’en out of the town armoury, with a broken hilt, and chapeless; with two broken points; his horse hipp’d, with an old motley saddle and stirrups of no kindred; besides, possess’d with the glanders and like to mose in the chine, troubled with the lampass, infected with the fashions, full of windgalls, sped with spavins, rayed with the yellows, past cure of the fIVes, stark spoil’d with the staggers, begnawn with the bots, sway’d in the back and shoulder-shotten, near-legg’d before, and with a half-cheek’d bit, and a head-stall of sheep’s leather which, being restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been often burst, and now repaired with knots; one girth six times piec’d, and a woman’s crupper of velure, which hath two letters for her name fairly set down in studs, and here and there piec’d with pack-thread.</p>
			<p class="character">Baptista</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who comes with him?</p>
			<p class="character">Biondello</p>
			<p class="prose">O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparison’d like the horse- with a linen stock on one leg and a kersey boot-hose on the other, gart’red with a red and blue list; an old hat, and the humour of forty fancies prick’d in’t for a feather; a monster, a very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian footboy or a gentleman’s lackey.</p>
			<p class="character">Tranio</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;</p>

			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Who shall begin?</p>
			<p class="character">Lucentio</p>
			<p class="verseline">That will I.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.</p>
			<p class="character">Biondello</p>
			<p class="verseline">I go. Exit</p>
			<p class="character">Baptista</p>
			<p class="verseline">Son, I’ll be your half Bianca comes.</p>
			<p class="character">Lucentio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I’ll have no halves; I’ll bear it all myself.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Re-enter Biondello</h2>
			<p class="verseline">How now! what news?</p>
			<p class="character">Biondello</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sir, my mistress sends you word</p>
			<p class="verseline">That she is busy and she cannot come.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">How! She’s busy, and she cannot come!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Is that an answer?</p>
			<p class="character">Gremio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Ay, and a kind one too.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I hope better.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife</p>
			<p class="verseline">To come to me forthwith. Exit Biondello</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">O, ho! entreat her!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, then she must needs come.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am afraid, sir,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Re-enter Biondello</h2>
			<p class="verseline">Now, where’s my wife?</p>
			<p class="character">Biondello</p>
			<p class="verseline">She says you have some goodly jest in hand:</p>
			<p class="verseline">She will not come; she bids you come to her.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Intolerable, not to be endur’d!</p>
			<p class="verseline">Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Say I command her come to me. Exit Grumio</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I know her answer.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">What?</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">She will not.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Re-enter Katherina</h2>
			<p class="character">Baptista</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now, by my holidame, here comes Katherina!</p>
			<p class="character">Katherina</p>
			<p class="verseline">What is your sir, that you send for me?</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Where is your sister, and Hortensio’s wife?</p>
			<p class="character">Katherina</p>
			<p class="verseline">They sit conferring by the parlour fire.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Go, fetch them hither; if they deny to come.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Exit Katherina</h2>
			<p class="character">Lucentio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.</p>
			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">And so it is. I wonder what it bodes.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Marry, peace it bodes, and love, and quiet life,</p>
			<p class="verseline">An awful rule, and right supremacy;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And, to be short, what not that’s sweet and happy.</p>
			<p class="character">Baptista</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now fair befall thee, good Petruchio!</p>
			<p class="verseline">The wager thou hast won; and I will ad</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Another dowry to another daughter,</p>
			<p class="verseline">For she is chang’d, as she had never been.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Nay, I will win my wager better yet,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And show more sign of her obedience,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Her new-built virtue and obedience.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">Re-enter Katherina with Bianca and Widow</h2>
			<p class="verseline">See where she comes, and brings your froward wIVes</p>
			<p class="verseline">As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Katherine, that cap of yours becomes you not:</p>
			<p class="verseline">Off with that bauble, throw it underfoot.</p>
			<h2 class="stagedirection balance-text">[Katherina complies]</h2>
			<p class="character">Widow</p>
			<p class="verseline">Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh</p>
			<p class="verseline">Till I be brought to such a silly pass!</p>
			<p class="character">Bianca</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?</p>
			<p class="character">Lucentio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I would your duty were as foolish too;</p>
			<p class="verseline">The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Hath cost me a hundred crowns since supper-time!</p>
			<p class="character">Bianca</p>
			<p class="verseline">The more fool you for laying on my duty.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Katherine, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women</p>
			<p class="verseline">What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.</p>
			<p class="character">Widow</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come, come, you’re mocking; we will have no telling.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come on, I say; and first begin with her.</p>
			<p class="character">Widow</p>
			<p class="verseline">She shall not.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">I say she shall. And first begin with her.</p>
			<p class="character">Katherina</p>
			<p class="verseline">Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And dart not scornful glances from those eyes</p>
			<p class="verseline">To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor.</p>
			<p class="verseline">It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And in no sense is meet or amiable.</p>
			<p class="verseline">A woman mov’d is like a fountain troubled-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty</p>
			<p class="verseline">Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And for thy maintenance commits his body</p>
			<p class="verseline">To painful labour both by sea and land,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And craves no other tribute at thy hands</p>
			<p class="verseline">But love, fair looks, and true obedience-</p>
			<p class="verseline">Too little payment for so great a debt.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Such duty as the subject owes the prince,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Even such a woman oweth to her husband;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And not obedient to his honest will,</p>
			<p class="verseline">What is she but a foul contending rebel</p>
			<p class="verseline">And graceless traitor to her loving lord?</p>
			<p class="verseline">I am asham’d that women are so simple</p>
			<p class="verseline">To offer war where they should kneel for peace;</p>
			<p class="verseline">Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,</p>
			<p class="verseline">When they are bound to serve, love, and obey.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Unapt to toll and trouble in the world,</p>
			<p class="verseline">But that our soft conditions and our hearts</p>
			<p class="verseline">Should well agree with our external parts?</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come, come, you froward and unable worins!</p>
			<p class="verseline">My mind hath been as big as one of yours,</p>
			<p class="verseline">My heart as great, my reason haply more,</p>
			<p class="verseline">To bandy word for word and frown for frown;</p>
			<p class="verseline">But now I see our lances are but straws,</p>
			<p class="verseline">Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,</p>
			<p class="verseline">That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.</p>
			<p class="verseline">Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,</p>
			<p class="verseline">And place your hands below your husband’s foot;</p>
			<p class="verseline">In token of which duty, if he please,</p>
			<p class="verseline">My hand is ready, may it do him ease.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Why, there’s a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.</p>
			<p class="character">Lucentio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Well, go thy ways, old lad, for thou shalt ha’t.</p>
			<p class="character">Vincentio</p>
			<p class="verseline">‘Tis a good hearing when children are toward.</p>
			<p class="character">Lucentio</p>
			<p class="verseline">But a harsh hearing when women are froward.</p>
			<p class="character">Petruchio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Come, Kate, we’ll to bed.</p>
			<p class="verseline">We three are married, but you two are sped.</p>
			<p class="verseline">[To Lucentio] ‘Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;</p>
			<p class="verseline">And being a winner, God gIVe you good night!</p>

			<p class="character">Hortensio</p>
			<p class="verseline">Now go thy ways; thou hast tam’d a curst shrow.</p>
			<p class="character">Lucentio</p>
